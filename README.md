# sentiment analyser for texts on a webpage
This tool analyses the textual contents (reviews,blogs,news,etc) on a website whether they are positive (appreciating,cheering,etc) ,negative (abusive,insulting,etc) or neutral,how many of them are positive or negative. One can just enter the page URL and this tool will tell about the sentiments of the texts on the page.This tool uses python requests api to download the page and BeautifulSoup api to extract texts from downloaded html file.These texts are further processed with the help of textblob which is an another python module for texts processing, textblob has many functionalities like tokenization,classification,sentiment analysis,parsing etc.I have used it for sentiment analysis.
